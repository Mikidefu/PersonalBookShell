# Pre-Configuration

‚úÖ 1. Download ngrok (if you haven‚Äôt yet)

Go to https://ngrok.com/download, download the Windows ZIP file, and extract it somewhere (e.g., C:\ngrok).

‚úÖ 2. Authenticate ngrok (first time only)
You need to add your auth token:

powershell

    .\ngrok.exe config add-authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
You can find your auth token here: https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup

‚úÖ 3. Start a tunnel

Run a tunnel to a local port 8080:

powershell

    .\ngrok.exe http 8080
‚úÖ 4. Access the public URL
After starting the tunnel, ngrok will show something like:


Forwarding    https://abc123.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8080

You have to put that public URL into the main.dart of the flutter app.

# üìö BookCollectionApp

A desktop and mobile application to manage and track your book collection, with support for automatic ISBN scanning via a mobile device camera.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- **Java 17+**
- **PostgreSQL** (database must be configured beforehand)
- **Flutter 3.x**
- **Ngrok**
- **Compatible IDEs:**
    - IntelliJ IDEA (for Java)
    - Visual Studio Code (for Flutter)
    - Other compatible IDEs are also supported

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Start the Spark Backend

Open your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA) and run the following file:

    src/spark/BookServer.java


This will start the Spark backend server, which handles communication between the Java app and the mobile application.

---

### 2. Launch the Java Desktop Application

In the same IDE (or another compatible one), run:

    src/app/BookCollectionApp.java


This is the main JavaFX application for managing your local book collection.

---

### 3. Start Ngrok Tunnel

Open **PowerShell** or any terminal and run:

```bash
ngrok http 8080
```

Ngrok will provide you with a public URL, like:

    https://random-id.ngrok.io

### 4. Configure the Flutter Mobile App

link to the appMobile repo: https://github.com/Mikidefu/isbn_reader/tree/main/isbn_reader/lib

   Open the file:

    lib/main.dart
and replace the value of the BackendUrl variable with the Ngrok URL, for example:


    const String BackendUrl = "https://random-id.ngrok.io/books";
Save the file.

### 5. Run the Flutter Mobile App
   Open Visual Studio Code (or any Flutter-supported IDE) and run:


  ```bash 
  flutter run
  ```
Make sure a device is connected (either an emulator or a physical device), and that Flutter is properly set up.

‚úÖ At This Point, Everything Should Be Functional!
The desktop app allows manual entry and statistics tracking of books.

The mobile app allows ISBN scanning and one-click insertion into the desktop system via backend communication.
